"""Guards for privileged Visagate actions (disable / uninstall / change PIN).

Two independent unlock paths are supported, matching the request: the
account's real password, or a separate Visagate-only PIN. Either is
accepted so a PIN can be handed out for quick toggling without sharing
the real system password.

IMPORTANT: password verification here deliberately does NOT go through
the system `sudo`/`login`/`kde` PAM stacks, because Visagate itself adds
a `pam_exec.so ... sufficient` face-auth line to those. If we verified
"do you know the password" via regular `sudo`, a successfully spoofed (or
just successfully recognized) face would satisfy that check too, letting
face recognition alone disable face recognition. Instead we maintain our
own tiny PAM service, `visagate-verify`, containing nothing but
`pam_unix.so` -- no face auth is ever added to it -- so this check can
only ever be satisfied by the real account password.
